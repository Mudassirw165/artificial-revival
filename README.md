# Revive-Bio: Digital Life Restoration Framework

This project explores the possibility of digital and biological resurrection — not as fantasy, but as the scientific pursuit of life extension through cryonics, neural simulation, and AI.

## 🌱 Project Goals
- Simulate cellular viability post-cryopreservation
- Explore brain activity recording for potential revival
- Build AI models to predict successful revival conditions
- Reflect on the philosophical and spiritual meaning of "reviving the dead"

# 🔮 Vision
Life is precious. Death may not be final. This repository takes the first computational steps toward preserving and restoring life through a blend of biology, machine learning, and metaphysics.
